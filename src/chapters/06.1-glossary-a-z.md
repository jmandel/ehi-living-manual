# Chapter 6.1: Glossary A-Z

*Purpose: A comprehensive reference of Epic and healthcare IT terminology to decode the language of EHI exports.*

This glossary provides quick definitions and context for terms you'll encounter throughout Epic EHI data. Each entry includes the term, a concise definition, where you'll find it in the data, and practical usage notes.

---

## A

**ACCESS_LOG** - Table tracking user access to patient records. Critical for HIPAA auditing and compliance monitoring. While not commonly found in EHI exports, access logs demonstrate who viewed or modified patient data.

**ACCOUNT** - The financial container for charges and payments. In professional billing (`ACCOUNT` table), groups charges for a guarantor. Links to patients through `ACCOUNT.GUARANTOR_ID`.

<example-query description="View account structure with guarantor relationships">
-- See how accounts link to patients
SELECT 
  a.ACCOUNT_ID,
  a.ACCOUNT_NAME,
  a.PAT_REC_OF_GUAR_ID as guarantor_patient_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ap.PAT_ID) as patients_on_account
FROM ACCOUNT a
LEFT JOIN ACCT_GUAR_PAT_INFO ap ON a.ACCOUNT_ID = ap.ACCOUNT_ID
GROUP BY a.ACCOUNT_ID, a.ACCOUNT_NAME, a.PAT_REC_OF_GUAR_ID
LIMIT 5;
</example-query>

**ACUITY_LEVEL_C** - Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage level (1-5). Lower numbers indicate more critical patients. Essential for emergency department analytics and resource allocation.

**ADT** - Admission, Discharge, Transfer. Core patient movement events that track a patient's journey through facilities.
- Tables: `CLARITY_ADT`, `PAT_ENC_HSP`
- Critical for: Census tracking, length of stay calculations, patient flow analysis

<example-query description="View ADT events showing patient movement">
-- Track patient movements through ADT events
SELECT 
  EVENT_TYPE_C_NAME,
  PAT_ENC_CSN_ID,
  EFFECTIVE_TIME,
  EVENT_SUBTYPE_C_NAME
FROM CLARITY_ADT
WHERE PAT_ENC_CSN_ID IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY EFFECTIVE_TIME DESC
LIMIT 10;
</example-query>

**AMOUNT** - Financial field in transaction tables. Sign convention varies by table - always check documentation to determine if positive values represent charges or payments.

**ARPB** - Accounts Receivable Professional Billing. Epic's professional fee billing system for physician and outpatient services.
- Key tables: `ARPB_TRANSACTIONS`, `ARPB_TX_VOID`, `ARPB_TX_ACTIONS`
- Handles: Office visits, consultations, professional procedures

<example-query description="Explore ARPB transaction types">
-- See different types of professional billing transactions
SELECT 
  TX_TYPE_C_NAME,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  SUM(AMOUNT) as total_amount

**ATTENDING_PROV_ID** - Primary responsible provider for a hospital admission. Legal responsibility for patient care decisions. Found in `PAT_ENC_HSP` and related inpatient tables.

---

## B

**BENEFIT_PLAN_ID** - Links to specific insurance plan benefits and coverage rules. Determines what services are covered and at what level.

**BILLING_PROV_ID** - Provider who bills for the service. May differ from the performing provider in group practices or teaching hospitals where residents perform services under attending supervision.

**BPA** - Best Practice Advisory. Clinical decision support alerts that guide providers toward evidence-based care. While BPA definitions rarely appear in EHI exports, their firing history may be tracked.

**BUCKET** - A container concept in hospital billing representing stages of financial liability. Common buckets include:
1. Expected reimbursement from insurance
2. Patient responsibility (deductible, copay)
3. Bad debt or charity care

Note: The term "bucket" appears in Epic documentation but actual `HSP_BUCKET` tables are not always present in EHI exports.

---

## C

FROM CLARITY_ADT
WHERE EVENT_TYPE_C_NAME IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY EVENT_TYPE_C_NAME

## Common Patterns

### Table Naming Conventions
- **CLARITY_** - Master/reference data
- **PAT_** - Patient-related
- **HSP_** - Hospital/inpatient
- **ARPB_** - Professional billing
- **V_** - Views
- **ZC_** - Category lists

### Field Naming Patterns
- **_C** - Category (numeric code)
- **_C_NAME** - Category name (decoded value)
- **_ID** - Identifier
- **_YN** - Yes/No flag
- **_DTTM** - Date/time timestamp
- **_DATE** - Date only
- **_TIME** - Time component

### Key Conceptual Patterns

**(ID, LINE) Composite Keys**  
Epic's solution for one-to-many relationships. The ID identifies the parent record, LINE sequences the children.

**Real Date Format**  
Dates stored as days since 12/31/1840. Requires conversion for human readability.

**Professional vs Hospital Billing**  
Two separate billing systems with different tables, workflows, and business rules.

**CSN vs MRN**  
CSN is internal/technical, MRN is external/human-readable. Both identify patients but serve different purposes.

## Key Takeaways

1. Epic terminology evolved over decades - some terms are historical artifacts
2. Many terms have specific Epic meanings different from general healthcare usage  
3. Understanding prefixes and suffixes accelerates learning
4. The (ID, LINE) pattern appears everywhere for multi-valued data
5. Financial and clinical worlds use different identifiers but connect through encounters
