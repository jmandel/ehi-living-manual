# Part 0: The EHI Foundation

*Before we analyze a single patient record, we must understand the landscape.*

Welcome to the foundation of your Epic EHI journey. In the four chapters that follow, you'll gain the essential context and tools needed to work confidently with Epic's Electronic Health Information export. This isn't just about learning a database schemaâ€”it's about understanding a revolution in healthcare data access that affects millions of patients and thousands of healthcare organizations.

Think of this part as your orientation day at a new job. We'll start with the "why" (the federal mandate that created this data), move to the "how" (your interactive exploration toolkit), reveal the master key (the `_metadata` table that makes the database self-documenting), and finally explain the "what" (Epic's unique dual-database architecture that shapes everything you'll see).

By the end of Part 0, you'll have:
- **Context**: Understanding of the 21st Century Cures Act and why this data exists
- **Tools**: Hands-on experience with our interactive SQL environment
- **Skills**: Mastery of the `_metadata` table for self-guided exploration
- **Foundation**: Knowledge of Epic's Chronicles-to-Clarity architecture

This foundation will serve you throughout your exploration of Epic's healthcare data ecosystem. Let's begin.
