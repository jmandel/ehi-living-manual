## Epic-Specific Identifiers

### CSN (Contact Serial Number)
A unique identifier assigned to each patient encounter or visit in Epic. The CSN remains constant throughout the encounter and serves as the primary key linking all encounter-related data. One inpatient stay may consist of multiple CSNs for different services (labs, radiology, etc.). Referenced as PAT_ENC_CSN_ID in the database.

### DX_ID
Epic's internal identifier for diagnoses in the CLARITY_EDG table. Unlike ICD codes, DX_ID is Epic's proprietary diagnosis identifier that remains consistent across the system.

### FIN (Financial Identification Number)
An identifier used for financial tracking and billing purposes. While similar to HAR, FIN specifically relates to the financial aspects of patient care and may be used differently by various healthcare organizations.

### HAR (Hospital Account Record)
The unique identifier for a hospital billing account in Epic. Stores hospital/technical charges, payments, and adjustments for encounters. Multiple encounters can share a single HAR for episode-based billing. Referenced as HSP_ACCOUNT_ID.

### MRN (Medical Record Number)
See PAT_MRN_ID.

### PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
The database column name for the Contact Serial Number. This is the primary identifier linking all data related to a specific patient encounter.

### PAT_ID
Epic's internal patient identifier that remains constant throughout the patient's lifetime in the system. Unlike the MRN, the PAT_ID is never visible to end users and is used exclusively for database relationships.

### PAT_MRN_ID
The Medical Record Number visible to clinicians and patients. This "human-facing" identifier appears on wristbands, documents, and user interfaces. May be facility-specific and can include prefixes indicating location.

### PROC_ID
Epic's internal identifier for procedures in the CLARITY_EAP table. Links to billable procedures and clinical services but does not directly contain CPT codes.

### TX_ID
Transaction identifier used in both ARPB_TRANSACTIONS (professional billing) and HSP_TRANSACTIONS (hospital billing) tables. Uniquely identifies each financial transaction.

### HTR (Hospital Transactions)
The Chronicles master file containing hospital billing transactions, extracted to HSP_TRANSACTIONS in Clarity.

### ICD (International Classification of Diseases)
Diagnosis codes maintained by WHO. ICD-10-CM for diagnoses, ICD-10-PCS for inpatient procedures. Note: Direct ICD mappings often missing from EHI exports.

### NPI (National Provider Identifier)
10-digit identifier for healthcare providers required for HIPAA transactions. Unique per provider, never recycled.

### UB (Uniform Bill)
The UB-04 claim form used for hospital billing. Revenue codes in CL_UB_REV_CODE support UB billing.

## Notes on Usage

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Epic table and column names are typically uppercase in documentation but may vary in actual implementations.

2. **Null vs. Empty**: Epic sometimes uses empty strings ('') interchangeably with NULL values, particularly in date fields.

3. **Text Values**: Category names (_C_NAME fields) require exact text matching‚ÄîEpic doesn't use the underlying numeric codes in EHI exports.

4. **Missing Data**: Not all Epic modules and tables appear in EHI exports. Research, surgical, and device tracking data often excluded.

5. **Version Variations**: Terms and structures may vary slightly between Epic versions and organizational configurations.
