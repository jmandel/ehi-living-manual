# Part 3: Core Administrative and Financial Domains

*Where clinical care meets financial reality—the business of healthcare.*

Welcome to the financial side of Epic's data model. In the three chapters that follow, you'll discover how a patient's clinical journey transforms into charges, payments, and ultimately, balanced accounts. This is where the idealism of healthcare delivery meets the pragmatism of revenue cycles, insurance complexities, and financial sustainability.

Epic's financial architecture reflects a fundamental reality: healthcare organizations operate two distinct billing systems. Hospital billing (using HSP_ tables) manages facility charges—the costs of rooms, operating theaters, and institutional services. Professional billing (using ARPB_ tables) handles provider charges—what doctors and specialists bill for their expertise. Together, these 67 specialized tables orchestrate a complex financial symphony.

Here's what you'll master:

- **Financial Accounts and Coverage**: Understanding guarantors, insurance filing orders, and the critical distinction between who receives care and who pays for it
- **Charges, Transactions, and Claims**: Following clinical services as they transform into billable line items with CPT codes and modifiers
- **Payments and Adjudication**: Tracing how insurance payments flow through remittances, EOBs, and transaction matching to zero out balances

This part builds on your clinical knowledge from Part 2. You'll see how encounter IDs link to hospital accounts, how diagnoses justify charges, and how the timing of services drives billing workflows. Most importantly, you'll understand Epic's elegant solution to a messy problem: maintaining complete financial audit trails while supporting the intricate dance of modern healthcare reimbursement.

By the end of Part 3, you'll be able to trace a single charge from creation to payment, understand why one patient might have multiple guarantor accounts, and decode the adjustment categories that explain where the money went.

Let's begin by answering healthcare's most fundamental financial question: Who pays the bill?
