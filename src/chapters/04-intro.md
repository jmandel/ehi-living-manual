# Part 4: Advanced Domains and Synthesis

*Where we explore specialized data domains and learn to answer complex, cross-cutting questions.*

Welcome to the advanced topics of Epic's EHI export. In the three chapters that follow, you'll go beyond the core clinical and financial data to explore specialized domains and learn techniques for sophisticated analysis. This is where your foundational knowledge comes together, enabling you to answer the complex questions that drive healthcare improvement.

Epic's comprehensiveness extends far beyond standard clinical documentation. Patient-generated data flows through MyChart portals. Social determinants shape health outcomes. Data quality issues hide in the gaps between systems. And the real power emerges when you link domains togetherâ€”connecting clinical outcomes to financial impact, or tracking quality metrics across populations.

Here's what you'll master:

- **Specialized and Patient-Generated Data**: Exploring MyChart communications, referral workflows, social history, and the specialized modules often excluded from EHI exports
- **Data Integrity and Validation**: Learning systematic approaches to find orphaned records, validate temporal sequences, and ensure data quality
- **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Building complex queries that span clinical, financial, and operational domains to answer real-world healthcare questions

This part synthesizes everything you've learned. You'll see how to combine the patterns from Part 1, the clinical knowledge from Part 2, and the financial understanding from Part 3 to solve complex analytical challenges. Most importantly, you'll develop the skills to explore independently, discovering insights that weren't anticipated by any documentation.

By the end of Part 4, you'll be able to trace a patient's complete journey through the system, identify data quality issues that affect reporting accuracy, and build the complex cross-domain queries that answer C-suite questions.

Let's begin by exploring the rich data that flows directly from patients themselves.
