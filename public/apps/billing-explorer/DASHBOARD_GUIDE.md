### 7. Charges by Department
**Bar chart** showing which hospital departments generated the most charges:

- Hover for visit count and exact amounts
- Helps identify where healthcare dollars are spent

### 8. Monthly Trends
**Line chart** tracking financial patterns over time:
- **Red line/area**: Monthly charges
- **Green line**: Monthly payments

- Helps visualize payment lag times

### 9. Encounter Details Table
**Detailed table** of recent healthcare visits showing:
- **Date**: When the visit occurred
- **Department**: Where the service was provided
- **Type**: Inpatient, outpatient, emergency, etc.
- **Charges**: Total charges for that visit
- **Payments**: Payments received for that visit
- **Balance**: Outstanding amount (highlighted in red if unpaid)
- **Days Ago**: How long since the visit

**Note on Zero-Dollar Encounters**: You may see encounters with $0.00 charges. These are real clinical visits where:
- Charges haven't been posted yet
- Services were covered under a capitated payment plan
- The visit was a no-charge follow-up
- Billing is still pending

The system filters out automated system-generated encounters (CLARITY ETL artifacts) to show only real clinical visits.

## Understanding Your Financial Data

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Positive financial indicators (payments, credits)
- **Red**: Amounts owed or charges
- **Blue**: Neutral information (encounters)
- **Orange**: Claims/administrative events

### Key Terms
- **Charges**: The full price of healthcare services
- **Allowed Amount**: What insurance agrees to pay
- **Deductible**: Amount you pay before insurance starts
- **Copay**: Fixed amount you pay per visit
- **Coinsurance**: Percentage you pay after deductible
- **Write-offs**: Amounts forgiven or adjusted

### Timeline Patterns to Look For
1. **Charge Lag**: Charges may appear days/weeks after service
2. **Payment Delay**: Insurance payments typically take 30-90 days
3. **Claim Resubmissions**: Multiple claims for same service date
4. **Payment Matching**: Payments should correspond to specific charges

## Tips for Using the Dashboard

### 1. Start with the Summary
Review the financial summary card first to understand your overall situation.

### 2. Check Coverage
Verify your insurance information is correct and up-to-date.

### 3. Follow the Timeline
Use the timeline to understand the sequence of events for each healthcare episode.

### 4. Trace the Money
Use the Sankey diagram to see how charges become your responsibility.

### 5. Review Encounters
Check the encounter table for any visits with outstanding balances.

### 6. Monitor Trends
Look at monthly trends to understand your healthcare spending patterns.

## Common Questions

### "Why is my balance negative?"
A negative balance means you have a credit - you've overpaid or adjustments were made in your favor.

### "Why don't payments match charges?"
Insurance often pays less than charged amounts based on contracted rates. The difference may be written off or become patient responsibility.

### "What if I see errors?"
Contact your healthcare provider's billing department with specific transaction IDs and dates from the dashboard.

### "How current is this data?"
The dashboard shows data as of the last extraction date. Financial data typically has a 24-48 hour processing delay.
